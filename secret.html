  <h2>For You 🤍</h2>

  <p>
    If you’re reading this, it means you stayed a little longer.
    It means curiosity or maybe care brought you here.
  </p>

  <p>
     I won’t repeat my apologies here.
     I just want to say something quietly 
     loving you was never a phase for me it's necessity for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even now I still think of you in small moments
    Songs Silences Random smiles
    You never really left my heart and you never will.
    You are my whole heart and I hope I get burried 6 feet under after I die so 
    when the bugs are eating my heart they will get to taste you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take all the time you need
    I’m not going anywhere anytime you need me come running to me.
    Any moment anything you don't feel like doing leave everything behind and run back home.
    If someday the whole world will stand against you look behind you and you will find me.
    I trsut your every ambition as a friend first and lover second I have never once doubted
    your ability. If only you could see yourself from my eyes then you'd have realised this 
    level of admiration still is alive. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I love you more and most mero baccha mutu mayalu❤️😘
  </p>
