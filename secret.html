    <h2>For You 🤍</h2>

    <p>
      If you're reading this, it means you stayed a little longer.
      It means curiosity or maybe care brought you here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I won’t repeat my apologies here.
      I just want to say something quietly 
      loving you was never a phase for me it’s a necessity for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even now I still think of you in small moments.<br>
      Songs. Silences. Random smiles.<br>
      You never really left my heart and you never will.<br>
      You are my whole heart and I hope I get buried 6 feet under after I die so when the bugs eat my heart they will get to taste you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take all the time you need.<br>
      I’m not going anywhere — anytime you need me, come running to me.<br>
      Any moment you don’t feel like doing, leave everything behind and run back home.<br>
      If someday the whole world stands against you, look behind — you will find me.<br>
      I trust your every ambition as a friend first and lover second.<br>
      I have never once doubted your ability.<br>
      If only you could see yourself from my eyes, you’d realize this level of admiration is still alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you more and most mero baccha mutu mayalu ❤️🥰
