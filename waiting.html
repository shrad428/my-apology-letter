    <h1>If you ever come back 🤍</h1>

    <p>
      I’m not writing this to pull you back or to rush you.
      I just want to tell you something I talk alot haii even here 
      my kura is not sakking.
    </p>

    <p>
      You were and you are my only source of living.
      You were someone I chose with my whole heart
      and that choice never felt wrong till this day 
      you are the best choice i made and it will remain like this forever.
      Choosing you was the compensation for everything I lost and I truly
      believe it's god's way of saying sorry for the things that were taken
      from me. I have always told you that you are either my guardian angel
      or you were sent for me by my guardian ange and I firmly believe it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one day you think of me
      if you ever wonder whether I still care
      don't waste your energy in thinking i will never stop caring.
    </p>

    <p>
      No pressure. No expectations.
      Just a door that’s still open,
      whenever and if ever you choose to knock.
    </p>
