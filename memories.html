      This picture holds more than just a moment.  
      It reminds me of how naturally we fit how safe I felt
      and how I smiled without even realizing it.

      I look at this and remember how your presence alone
      made everything feel lighter and not to mention we 
      look kinda hot together😁
      Even ordinary days felt special with you.
